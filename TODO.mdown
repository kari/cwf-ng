# TODO

## Backlog to v1

* BBCode handling and editing
  * Check how texts are handled at each part of site, because some of them are missing BBcode decoding
* Downloads 
  * Implement Download throttling? ([PEAR::HTTP_Download](http://pear.php.net/package/HTTP_Download/))
    * PEAR isn't in Apple-bundled PHP
  * We can use the code from old version (dl.php)?
    * Need to port it from there to our Media-view
  * get could also redirect to a temporary public url.
	* apache is also really good at serving static files, maybe some .htaccess magic?
  

## Pre-launch v1

* PaterBot migration script
	* Migrate DB
* Handle legacy URL rewrites

## Deferred to v1.5

* Game (Hunter) workflow/lifecycle/process
  * This is huge.
* Blog comments
  * Defer to v1.5 or v2 with other blog functionalities?
* Birthday list
* Add this -buttons to game/view
* Similar games
  * Dont think if it is planned, but we might think of "similar games" or "more games from this creator" or "people who downloaded game x also downloaded game y" option displayed in gameinfo panel. Showing three games for example, like it is usually done.

## Deferred to v2 or later

* game/index and other filtering using GET instead of cookies
* Semantic Web
  * SearchMonkey Atom feeds (can't add until site is live)
  * Google implements same with Microformats (hReview etc.) or RDF+XHTML, but our site
    is HTML4 so microformats are the only way forward.
* GD-generated headings (SiteHelper::himg("Something or other") ?)
  * GD isn't in Apple-bundled PHP.
* Localization (l10n) and internationalization (i18n)
  * dk, de, fi, pl, â€¦
* Atom feeds with AtomHelper of a sort
* BBCode Rich text editor
* Social Web features (integration to Twitter etc.)
  * Integration requires JSON, PHP4 needs a library for it
  * oAuth, OpenID etc. to login (or to download?)
  * Facebook Connect, Google Connect, [Yahoo Updates](http://developer.yahoo.com/social/updates/)
* User <--> Developer mapping (not many right now)
* [OpenSearch](http://www.opensearch.org/)
* "Hey, you downloaded this game a week ago. Mind writing a review?"
* Intrasite linking (eg. "game:123", "guide:123")
* [Canonical urls](http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2009/02/specify-your-canonical.html)
* XML/Atom Gzipping
* One newsfeed for frontpage (maybe?)
* Pages/view (dynamic pages)
* Build script to stage new revisions to CWF
  * It's much easier with HG+SSH. Other tasks can be added to the Rakefile
* "Other links" to games. (new DB table, model...)
  * External links are easy, what about internal links?
* OpenID/oAuth/Facebook Connect/Google Friend Connect...
* FancyBox alternatives
  * We have jQuery Tools that has some nice overlays.
  * [FaceBox](http://www.dynamicdrive.com/dynamicindex4/facebox/index.htm) can show DIVs and other stuff
  * [Popeye](http://herr-schuessler.de/blog/jquerypopeye-an-inline-lightbox-alternative/) can zoom images inline, how desirable is this behaviour?
  * [Slimbox2](http://www.digitalia.be/software/slimbox2) a Lightbox clone for jQuery
  * [Colorbox](http://colorpowered.com/colorbox/) is something new and shiny, but couldn't notice any advantages.
* Games/index
  * Paging alphabetically [A] [B]...
