# TODO

* Fix Forms styling
* Downloads
  * Implement Download throttling? ([PEAR::HTTP_Download](http://pear.php.net/package/HTTP_Download/))
    * PEAR isn't in Apple-bundled PHP.
  * We can use the code from old version?
* Blog comments
* Screenshots to latest games (front page)
  * Layout? Carousels?
  * [Scrollable](http://www.flowplayer.org/tools/scrollable.html) makes a nice carousel
* Games/index
  * Games/index filter by genre, platform, score
  * Fix sorting from default ASC to DESC. (bug in CakePHP)
  * Paging alphabetically [A] [B]...
* Tools/index and others (layout, info)
* Fix screenshot jQuery (Opera support?)
  * [FancyBox](http://fancy.klade.lv/) should be updated soon. 
  * Old version of Fancybox doesn't work with jQuery 1.3.0
  * [FaceBox](http://www.dynamicdrive.com/dynamicindex4/facebox/index.htm) can show DIVs and other stuff
  * [Popeye](http://herr-schuessler.de/blog/jquerypopeye-an-inline-lightbox-alternative/) can zoom images inline, how desirable is this behaviour?
  * [Slimbox2](http://www.digitalia.be/software/slimbox2) a Lightbox clone for jQuery  
* BBCode handling and editing (Rich text editor?)
* Model validations
* Build script to stage new revisions to CWF
* "Other links" to games. (new DB table, model...)
  * External links are easy, what about internal links?
* Advertising elements
* Pages/view (dynamic pages)
* One newsfeed for frontpage (maybe?)
* XML/Atom Gzipping
* PHP4 compat. (html_entities multichar...)
  * $html->link mangles UTF-8 accented characters(?)

## Deferred to v2

* SearchMonkey Atom feeds (can't add until site is live)
* GD-generated headings (SiteHelper::himg("Something or other") ?)
  * GD isn't in Apple-bundled PHP.
* Localization (l10n) and internationalization (i18n)
  * dk, de, fi, pl, â€¦
* Atom feeds with AtomHelper of a sort
* Game (Hunter) workflow/lifecycle/process
* Social web features (integration to Twitter etc.)
  * Integration requires JSON, PHP4 needs a library for it
  * Friend Connect, OpenID etc. to login (or to download?)
* User <-> Developer mapping (not many right now)
* [OpenSearch](http://www.opensearch.org/)
* "Hey, you downloaded this game a week ago. Mind writing a review?"
