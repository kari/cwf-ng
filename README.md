# Frequently Asked Questions

### What is this?

This, gentlemen, is the CWF-ng. The next generation content management system for CWF. It's the future.

### What's so next generation about this?

CWF-ng has many interesting new features. Many of these features were things that had been on the table for years, but were difficult to implement in the old system: Text mark-up (using BBCode), commenting, and generally managing all that content we had in the depths of our database.

We have also focused on usability and made it easier to find stuff. One keyword is community building. We want to engage our users better.

### You keep referring to "we". Who are "you" actually?

The original site was mostly coded by Maz. One dark autumn night in 2008 Zyx decided to make a copy of the database and started rebuilding the site. "We" is the crew of active CWF fanatics who have bombarded Maz and Zyx with feature requests and ideas since the early days of the site. Those two guys just wrote the stuff down so that computers would do our bidding.

### So, what's in it for me as a user?

Well, now you have a blog! Isn't that great? And that's not all. We have added RSS feeds and made it easier for you to participate in our community. It should now be easier for you to rate, review, comment and even suggest new games. Reviews, tools, guides and interviews are also right there helping you out to enjoy the world of freeware.

And don't forget the forums!

### Oh great, more games. If I, as a Game Hunter, wasn't already struggling with the amount of games we add daily to the site already.

Don't worry, Mr. Game Hunter. The new site will make the process of adding games to site easier and faster. No more using FTP to add screenshots, you can do it directly from game administration interface.

### I don't care. I'm not even a user of this site.

But you might soon be. You see, we have also made our pages such that popular search engines will have easier time digesting all the yummy information we have about games. When you're looking for information about your favorite games, you will more often notice that our site is up there in the search results.

### So, what happens to the old site?

Well. That's a good question. The forum we're using remains phpbb2, which is getting pretty old by now. Some time in the future we will upgrade that to something else. But we don't want to even think about that right now.

### When will it be ready?

Current estimate is summer 2009.
